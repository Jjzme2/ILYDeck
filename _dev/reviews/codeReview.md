# Code Review

## Strengths

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: The codebase follows a component-based architecture, which is a best practice in modern web development. This makes the code modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
2. **Use of Pinia for State Management**: The use of Pinia for state management is a good choice. It is intuitive, type-safe, and integrates well with Vue 3.
3. **API Abstraction**: The `baseApi.js` file abstracts common API functions, which promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.
4. **Responsive Design**: The CSS styles are designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different devices.
5. **Clear and Descriptive Comments**: The code includes clear and descriptive comments, which help in understanding the code and its purpose.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: While there is some error handling in the API calls, it could be improved by providing user-friendly error messages and handling different types of errors more gracefully.
2. **Code Duplication**: There are instances of code duplication, particularly in the API functions. Consider refactoring to reduce redundancy.
3. **Testing**: There is no mention of unit or integration tests. Adding tests would improve the reliability of the code and make it easier to catch bugs early.
4. **Documentation**: While there are comments in the code, a more comprehensive documentation, such as a README file with setup instructions and a description of the project structure, would be beneficial.
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following best practices for web accessibility, such as using semantic HTML and ARIA roles.
